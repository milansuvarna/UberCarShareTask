Introduction -

This framework consist of UI functional automation for ubercarshare.com/search for github Teams api.
The number of test cases are limited as of now but can be easily added later.
NOTE : The projects download Maven dependencies when run for the first time. Subsequent runs will be faster.

Prerequisites:

Chrome browser preferably latest version should be installed in the runtime environment.
Java 8
Optional - IDE prefereably Eclipse should be available for running tests via it.

Instructions to run:

Run via xml file : This is available only for the ui automation right now. Right click on the xml file name or from within the open xml file in eclipse. Select ‘Run as testNG suite’. This can be later used to run targeted tests based on group tags, different xml for Smoke or other tests etc using Jenkins.


Reports:

A cucumber report link is generated in the console and it can be opened in the browser after the test is completed.
In Eclipse, there are default testing reports as well available at test-output folder under the project.
